# Introduction to The Web

## Overview of Class for 7th of August

### How the web works
* get students to download the example files
and to open the .html file up in the web browser
* they will see the url starts will file:// this means we are viewing the file locally. Just like when you open a file on your computer.
* get them to go to the assignment url it starts with http, this means we are viewing the page we are viewing over the internet. Basically when you put in a url, your computer requests files from a server that is hosting them, with this basic web page the browser interprets the html and the css files and displays it in the browser
the html (hypertext markup language) describes the content of the page (i.e. the text, and what type of content the text is)
* the css (cascading style sheet styles the page)
*(do we have content to add to this in the web media folder?)

### Course Tools
we use Brackets to edit the html
(which browser do we use now?)
get them to open the html file up in Brackets, 
go through the basic document structure?
look at the code and change something
then go back to the local file and refresh it, they can see the changes

### Uploading a file to the server (we give them a base file) - we have a setup now that students will be using throughout their degree, will give you details on how this works.
Andrew will send this through and you can test out
Get all students to access their site folders
And to upload the base example file and look at it over the internet 
Change something locally and then upload again and refresh
You don’t need to upload every time you make a change
You can work on your file and view locally, and then upload when you are happy with all of your edits

### Basic HTML elements (i.e. h, p , img)
open up the basic html file 
talk through html tags
html is a markup langauge
it uses ‘tags’ to describe the content of the page
When we have everything from a start tag to an end tag, it is is called a HTML element, some html elements have content, which is placed between the tags, some html elements like the br or img elements do not, these tags close and open in the one tag, see a tag in the example. In the image below are some common HTML tags which are covered in the lecture and with which you can mark up your content semantically.
Go through each of the tags h1 - h6 is the hierarchy of headings, with h1 the most semantically
