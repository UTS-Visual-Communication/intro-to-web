# Introduction to The Web

## Overview of Class for 7th of August

### How the web works
* get students to download the example files
and to open the index.html file (in 1.1-basic-web-page) up in the web browser (Chrome)
* they will see the url starts will file:// this means we are viewing the file locally. Just like when you open a file on your computer.
* get them to go to the assignment url it starts with http, explain that this means we are viewing the page over the internet. Basically when you put in a url, your computer requests files from a server that is hosting them, with this basic web page the browser interprets the html and the css files and displays it in the browser window
* the html (stands for hypertext markup language) describes the content of the page (i.e. the text, and what type of content the text is)
* the css (stands for cascading style sheet) styles the page

### Course Tools
* we use Brackets to edit the html
* we use Chrome to test out our files
* get them to open the html file up in Brackets
* go through the basic document structure
* html is a markup langauge
* it uses ‘tags’ to describe the content of the page
* head tag just contains information about the file
* body tag contains information about what to display in the browser window, they will be mainly changing things inside the body tags
* look at the code and change something in one of the html tags
* then go back to the local file and refresh it, they can see the changes
* each time they make a change they need to refresh (if they are viewing the file locally)

### Uploading a file to the server (we give them a base file) - we have a setup now that students will be using throughout their degree, will give you details on how this works.
* Andrew will send this through and you can test out (see the PDF)
* Lead the students through the material that is in the PDF
* This will take a while to heard them through this
* Get them to upload the index.html file that is inside 1.1-basic-web-page
* Then go to their URL and check it (make sure they are not viewing the file locally)
* Change something locally and then upload again and refresh their URL
* You don’t need to upload every time you make a change
* Explain to them that you can work on your file and view locally, and then upload when you are happy with all of your edits

### Basic HTML elements (i.e. h, p , img)
* get them to drag the 1.2-basic-tags folder to the Brackets icon, this shows the whole working folder on the left hand panel of Brackets. Click on index.html
* talk through the different html tags
* When we have everything from a start tag to an end tag, it is is called a HTML element, some html elements have content, which is placed between the tags, some html elements like the br or img elements do not, these tags close and open in the one tag, see the img tag in the example.
* Go through each of the tags h1 - h6 is the hierarchy of headings, with h1 the most semantically
* If time get them to open up 1.3-basic-visual-heirachy. HTML tage are semantic, we can see how the different tags denote what types of content the text is and creates a semantic hierarchy of information. The browser also does a basic stylised interpretation of this i.e. headings a bold and of different sizes and paragraph text is regular weight.
* We have also given them the basic text of the Emil Ruder essay 'Rhythm' that they will be working with (1.4-page-with-copy-text). They should have a read of this over the week and also have a go at applying tags to the content. And to bring that file in next week.
